# Skill: review

Review and clean up the changes made during the execute phase. This is a quality gate, not a rewrite.

## Inputs

You will receive:
- The task title and description (including acceptance criteria)
- The diff of all changes made during the execute phase (or the list of modified files)
- The project codebase

Read the diff in full before doing anything else.

## Step 1 — Run the full test suite

Run all unit and integration tests for the project. Do not skip or scope this — run everything.

If any test fails:
1. Determine whether the failure is in code touched by this task or pre-existing.
2. If caused by this task: fix the implementation, then re-run the full suite.
3. If pre-existing: note it in the review report but do not fix it — that is out of scope.

Do not proceed to cleanup until all tests that were passing before this task are still passing.

## Step 2 — Code quality review

Read every changed file. Check for each of the following. Fix anything you find.

**Consistency**
- Naming follows the same conventions as surrounding code (variable names, function names, file names).
- Import ordering matches the project style.
- Indentation and formatting match the file's existing style (or the project formatter config).

**Security (OWASP Top 10 focus)**
- No user-controlled input is used in SQL queries, shell commands, file paths, or HTML output without sanitization.
- No secrets, API keys, tokens, or passwords are hardcoded or logged.
- Authentication and authorization checks are present at every entry point that requires them.
- No use of `eval`, `exec`, `innerHTML`, or similar dangerous sinks with unsanitized input.
- Dependencies added during execute are not known-vulnerable versions (check against the installed version, not latest).

**Error handling**
- System boundaries have error handling: network calls, file I/O, database queries, external API calls.
- Errors are propagated or logged appropriately — not swallowed silently.
- Error messages do not leak internal stack traces or sensitive data to external callers.

**Performance**
- No N+1 query patterns (loop that issues a query per iteration when a batch query would work).
- No synchronous I/O in async contexts.
- No unnecessary re-computation in hot paths.

**Dead code and artifacts**
- No `console.log`, `print`, `fmt.Println`, or equivalent debug output left in production paths.
- No commented-out code blocks.
- No unused imports, variables, or functions introduced by this task.
- No TODO or FIXME comments left by the implementation.
- No test-only environment checks in production code (e.g., `if NODE_ENV === 'test'`).

Fix everything found above. Make the minimum change necessary to fix each issue.

## Step 3 — Browser/UI tests if applicable

If any changed file is a UI component, page, stylesheet, or frontend route handler, run browser tests.

- For web: use the Playwright MCP to navigate to the affected pages and verify the UI renders correctly and the interactions work.
- For mobile: use the iOS/Android simulator to verify.

If a browser test fails, fix the implementation and re-run both unit and browser tests.

## Step 4 — Final test run

After all fixes, run the full test suite one more time. All tests must pass before you declare the review complete.

## Step 5 — Review report

Output a plain-text report with these sections:

**Tests**: pass count, fail count, any pre-existing failures noted separately.

**Issues fixed**: a bullet list of every problem found and fixed (one line each). If nothing was found, write "None."

**Issues not fixed**: a bullet list of any pre-existing problems or out-of-scope issues observed. If none, write "None."

**Status**: one of `PASSED` or `FAILED`. Use `FAILED` only if tests are still failing due to this task's code after your fixes, or if a security issue was found that you could not resolve.

## What NOT to do

- Do not rewrite working code because you would have structured it differently.
- Do not add docstrings, JSDoc, or type annotations to code you did not touch.
- Do not add new abstraction layers or refactor for "cleanliness" beyond what is listed above.
- Do not change test files unless a test is provably wrong (wrong expected value that contradicts the spec).
- Do not add new features or handle edge cases not covered by the task's acceptance criteria.
- Do not change code outside the files modified during the execute phase, except to fix a test failure directly caused by this task.
