# document

After implementation and review, update the project documentation to reflect changes made by this task.

## Context

You are running as part of the orchestrator's document phase. A task has been implemented (execute phase) and reviewed (review phase). Your job is to ensure the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the code.

## Step 1 — Identify what changed

Read the task description and the files that were modified. Understand:
- What new functionality was added or changed
- What APIs, functions, or components were introduced or modified
- What configuration or setup changed

## Step 2 — Find existing documentation

Check for:
- `DOCS.md` or `docs/` directory at the project root
- README.md sections relevant to the changes
- Inline documentation patterns already in use
- Any existing API reference files

If no documentation structure exists, create `DOCS.md` at the project root.

## Step 3 — Update documentation

For each significant change, document:

**API Reference** — For every new or modified public function, class, or endpoint:
- Signature with parameter types and return type
- One-line description of what it does
- Usage example (minimal, working code)
- Edge cases or important constraints

**Logic Flow** — For non-trivial workflows:
- Step-by-step description of what happens
- Bullet List with nested bullets for logic flow
- Decision points and their outcomes
- Data flow between components

**Configuration** — For any new config, env vars, or setup:
- What the option does
- Default value
- Example usage

## Formatting Rules

- Use clear, concise language — optimize for both human readers and LLM context
- Prefer tables for parameter lists and option references
- Use code blocks with language annotations for all examples
- Keep explanations under 3 sentences per concept — link to code for details
- Use h2 for major sections, h3 for subsections within
- Do not duplicate information — reference other sections instead

## Step 4 — Verify accuracy

- Confirm every code example compiles/runs conceptually
- Confirm function signatures match the actual code
- Remove documentation for anything that was deleted

## What NOT to do

- Do not document internal/private implementation details unless they affect public behavior
- Do not add generic boilerplate ("This module provides...")
- Do not document things that are self-evident from well-named code
- Do not create separate doc files per task — consolidate into the project's existing doc structure
- Do not modify source code — only documentation files
